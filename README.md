This repository is where I document my **learning, notes, and methodologies** related to **bug bounty hunting and web application security**.

It is continuously updated to cover the **complete bug bounty workflow**, including:
- Enumeration and reconnaissance
- Attack surface identification
- Technology fingerprinting
- Manual vulnerability testing
- Methodology refinement

The purpose of this repository is to **build and share structured security thinking** — not just tools or commands.

I focus on:
- Understanding *why* a technique works
- Mapping technology to likely vulnerabilities
- Manual testing over blind automation
